        This book breaks down the four kinds of loves which people feel: affection, friendship, eros (though not strictly erotic),
        and charity. The last, in particular really stuck out to me. This kind of understanding of charity was something that seems
        lost to me, which Lewis explains is the result of people associating the term with "giving alms." A better understanding of
        what the word means would be "gift-love."
        It's awesome to me that Lewis had such a heartfelt grasp on his faith as would be required to write this book. Often, thinkers
        like Lewis tend to lose sight of the joy they originally sought after, but that doesn't seem to be true in Lewis' writing. His
        descriptions make it easy to understand him, and the understanding of these christ-centered concepts is really worth having.
