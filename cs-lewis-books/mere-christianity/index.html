        This book does a great job at accomplishing its main goal: defining mere Christianity - or what it means to be a Christian
        (without the theological squabbling which otherwise divides the church). I was also really impressed by the reasoning used
        to argue for the reality and significance of mere christianity, or the "what reason is there to believe" and the "why should
        I consider it?" It seems to me that, perhaps to an even greater extent today, most people aren't aware of a good answer to
        either question. Because of that, they block themselves from really pondering whether God is a reality. While I think this
        book only really provides a starting ground for understanding apologetics, I think Lewis answers these questions in a great
        way. Lewis also shares some really interesting insights with regards to christian ethics and morality, which you can tell by
        the fact that this book in particular is frequently referenced by modern theologians, preachers, and apologists. Most people
        that regularly attend church have probably heard this book brought up by their pastor.
