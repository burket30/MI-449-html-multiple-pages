    <p>
        Till we have Faces is my favorite fiction work from C.S. Lewis. He seemlessly connects the wonder and mysteriousness
        of pagan mythology to a Christian narrative through his use of allegory. His allegory is the good kind, which uses
        metaphor to say in one book what it would have taken many more to say in literalistically. The story uses the joys
        and tragedies of its main character to demonstrate how hard it is recognize reality through our own self deception.
